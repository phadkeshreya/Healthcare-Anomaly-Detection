🏥 Healthcare Data Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in healthcare operational data using Machine Learning techniques. The system identifies abnormal patient records based on unusual patterns in vital signs and billing information.

The Isolation Forest algorithm is used for unsupervised anomaly detection.

🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare institutions generate large amounts of patient data including age, blood pressure, glucose level, hospital stay duration, and billing amount. Manual detection of abnormal records is time-consuming and inefficient.

This project aims to automatically detect anomalous healthcare records using machine learning.

🛠 Technologies Used
